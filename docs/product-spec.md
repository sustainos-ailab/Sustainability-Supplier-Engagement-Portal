# Product Spec — The Corporate Supplier Sustainability Portal 2026

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 12 June 2026
**Author:** Zyad Hatquai
**Status:** Confirmed

## Section 1 — Tool Summary

**Tool name:** The Corporate Supplier Sustainability Portal 2026

**What it does:** A single-page public landing page that onboards Tier 1 suppliers into The Corporate's ESRS-aligned sustainability assessment programme. It communicates the company's net-zero targets, explains the two submission paths, and routes each supplier to the correct action — EcoVadis scorecard submission or Excel questionnaire download.

**Who uses it:** Tier 1 supplier contacts — sustainability managers, EHS leads, and procurement representatives at supplier organisations — who receive the URL directly from The Corporate's procurement or EHS team.

**Why it exists:** To formally launch The Corporate's 2026 supplier sustainability assessment without requiring direct explanation from the internal team. The page gives every supplier the context, the correct path, the timeline, and the resources to act independently.

**Build status:** Retroactive spec — the tool exists as supplier_onboarding.html. This spec documents the existing build to establish Project Governor and Claude Code session compatibility, and to serve as the reference for any future iteration.

## Section 2 — Classification

### Data Model

**Decision:** D1

| Label | What it means | This tool? |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| D1 — Hardcoded | All data is written into the code by the developer. Users cannot input anything that persists. The tool displays what the developer put in. | Yes |
| D2 — Session | Data enters the tool during use and disappears when the tab closes. No database. | No |
| D3 — Persisted | Data is written to a database and survives after the session ends. Supabase is required. | No |

**Reason:** All content on the page is fixed and written by the developer. The Excel file is a static asset served for download. No supplier input is collected or stored through this tool.

**D3 triggers — none apply:**
- [ ] Data must be retrievable after the session ends
- [ ] Multiple sessions contribute to the same dataset
- [ ] An audit trail or history is needed
- [ ] Data submitted by one person must be visible to another
- [ ] Results must be accessible via a URL after the session ends
- [ ] Files uploaded by users must be stored and retrievable later

---

### Access Model

**Decision:** A1

| Label | What it means | This tool? |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| A1 — Public | Anyone with the URL can use it. No login, no account required. | Yes |
| A2 — Authentication | Users must log in. | No |
| A3 — Authorization | Users must log in and have different roles. | No |

**Reason:** The page is distributed to Tier 1 suppliers as a direct link. No account or login is required — any supplier who receives the URL can access it immediately.

---

### Tier

**Tier:** 1

| Tier | D+A combination | Stack | Deployment |
|------|----------------|-------|------------|
| 1 | D1+A1 or D2+A1 | Netlify only | Netlify |
| 2 | D3+A1 | Netlify + Supabase (no auth) | Netlify |
| 3 | D3+A2 or D3+A3 | Netlify + Supabase (auth + RLS) | Netlify |

---

### Standalone or Stack

**This tool is:** Standalone — it does not share a database with any other tool.

---

## Section 3 — Arms

### AI API Arm

**Active:** No

---

### Export Arm

**Active:** Yes

| Detail | Answer |
|--------|--------|
| Format | XLSX |
| What is exported | A pre-formatted Excel workbook — The Corporate Supplier Questionnaire 2026. Contains 7 sections mapped to ESRS: S1 General Information and EcoVadis Bypass, S2 Climate and Decarbonisation (E1), S3 Pollution and PFAS (E2), S4 Water and Marine Resources (E3), S5 Circular Economy and Waste (E5), S6 Biodiversity and Ecosystems (E4), S7 Social, Labour and Governance (S2, G1). The file is served as a static asset — no data is populated server-side. The supplier fills it offline and returns it via email or the process defined by The Corporate's EHS team. |
| PDF design intent | N/A — format is XLSX only |

---

### Email Arm

**Active:** No

---

### Scheduled Automation Arm

**Active:** No

| Deployment target | Netlify |
| Netlify MCP | See Open Questions (Section 15) — confirm before build session |

**GitHub — pre-build requirement:**
The builder creates the GitHub repo before the first Claude Code session. product-spec.md, CLAUDE.md, and PROGRESS.md must be uploaded to the repo root before Claude Code opens. Claude Code commits changes regularly and pushes to main. It does not create or configure the repo.

## Section 5 — Data Architecture

N/A — Data Model is D1. No database.

---

## Section 6 — Access and Permissions

N/A — Access Model is A1. No authentication, no roles, no RLS.

## Section 7 — GDPR

**GDPR outcome:** Not applicable — this tool is D1. No personal data is collected or stored through the tool. The Excel file is downloaded to the supplier's own device. No form submission occurs through this portal.

**What happens next:** All actions either open an external link in a new tab, trigger a file download, or open the user's email client. No page navigation occurs.

---

## Section 9 — Logic and Calculations

This tool contains no calculations, no scoring, and no conditional rendering based on user input.

Both submission paths (EcoVadis and Excel download) are visible simultaneously. The EcoVadis logic — "if you have a valid scorecard, you may skip the full questionnaire" — is communicated to the supplier in copy only. The tool does not gate or hide either path based on any user selection. The supplier self-selects and acts.

**The two interactive elements and their behaviour:**

| Element | Behaviour |
|---------|-----------|
| "Submit EcoVadis Scorecard" button | Opens https://ecovadis.com in a new tab (target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer") |
| "Download Assessment" button | Triggers download of /assets/The_Corporate_Supplier_Questionnaire_2026.xlsx using an HTML anchor with the download attribute |

---

## Section 10 — Brand and Visual Direction

**Brand reference:** the-corporate-brand skill file — upload flat to the repo root before the build session. Claude Code installs it to .claude/skills/ in First Session Setup.

**Visual feel:** Corporate minimalism — restraint over decoration. Precise, direct, composed, authoritative. No gradients, no shadows, no rounded corners.

**Key brand rules Claude Code must enforce throughout:**
- Fonts: Playfair Display (headlines), DM Sans 300 (body), DM Sans 500 (labels/emphasis) — import from Google Fonts CDN
- Colours: Ink (#000000), Stone (#B6B09F), Linen (#EAE4D5), Chalk (#F2F2F2), White (#FFFFFF), Acid Lime (#C8F135)
- Acid Lime: maximum 2 uses per page. Always against #000000 (never directly on light backgrounds). Used here for the "Supplier Programme 2026" label and the step number indicators in the timeline.
- Buttons: square corners (border-radius: 0), no shadows
- Cards: square corners, 0.5px Stone border, Linen or White background
- No blue links — underline + Ink colour only
- All copy follows The Corporate voice rules: short declarative sentences, active voice, no exclamation points, no emoji

---

## Section 11 — API and Credentials

This tool requires no external services and no API keys.

| Service | What it does | Key required | Where stored |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| None | — | — | — |

The Excel file is served as a static asset in the project's /assets/ folder. The EcoVadis button is a hardcoded URL. The Contact EHS button is a mailto: link. No server-side function, no API call, and no environment variable is required for this tool.

**Credentials readiness:** Nothing to prepare before the build session.

---

## Section 12 — Out of Scope — Phase 2

| Deferred feature | Reason it is deferred |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Online form — suppliers fill questionnaire responses in the browser | Adds D3 complexity (database, storage); v1 validates the workflow using the offline Excel |
| Internal review dashboard — procurement/EHS team reviews submissions in a tool | Requires a separate Tier 2 or Tier 3 tool in a stack; not needed to validate the supplier onboarding flow |
| Automated email notification on Excel download | Requires Email arm and server-side function; not required for v1 |
| Submission tracker — shows % of Tier 1 suppliers who have responded | Requires D3 and likely a supplier roster; deferred to the internal review tool |
| Supplier login and saved progress | Moves the tool to Tier 3; deferred to a future build iteration |
| Automated EcoVadis scorecard validation | Requires EcoVadis API access; deferred pending API availability |
